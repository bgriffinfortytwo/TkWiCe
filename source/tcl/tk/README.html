<p>
  Beside of own Tcl/Tk packages some sub-directories herein are not
  really a part of TkWiCe - they contains additional Tcl/Tk-software
  which may not be found in the standard Tcl/Tk setup of the user.
  Only in that special case the content of this sub-directory will
  be used.
</p><p>
  SO NOTE THAT ANY DIRECTORY HEREIN CONTAINS OWN COPYRIGHTS!
</p><p>
  Note also that in consideration of download size they might be
  reduced to their necessary parts (if reducing is allowed); For
  example a documentation could be cutted.
