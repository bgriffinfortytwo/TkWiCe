<h3>[01] About</h3>
<p>
  TkWiCe is a high featured, easy to use, multilingual, free and open source
  software application for wine cellar management. It provides a fast overview
  of your wine bottles.
</p><p>
  The software is written in native Tcl/Tk, so it works on all known operating
  systems (like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X etc.).
</p>

<h3>[02] Development Maximes</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
  <li>Focus is on pleasure, not on science.</li>
  <li>Function conquers eyecandy.</li>
  <li>The database is kept in readable text files.</li>
  <li>Fits on displays with 1024x768 pixel.</li>
  <li>Old computers are new enough.</li>
  <li>Works platform independent.</li>
  <li>Free - means liberty, free of charge and open source.</li>
</ul>

<a name="3"></a>
<h3>[03] Requirements</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>software: Tcl/Tk 8.5 or newer</li>
  <li>cpu: 233 MHz will be slow but work, 1.4 GHz are enough and to spare</li>
  <li>screen: 1024x786 pixel at 16 bit</li>
  <li>program diskspace: 2.1 MB</li>
  <li>database diskspace: depends on usage (expect 1 MB each 50 wines)</li>
  <li>memory: needed (allocates up to 35 MB)</li>
  <li>wine: one bottle (recommended: more)</li>
</ul><p>
  TkWiCe is mostly programmed on a machine running FreeBSD. It is so far known
  to run on any Windows, Mac OS X (ugly), Linux or FreeBSD operating systems.
</p><p>
  A UTF8 encoding file system is recommended - otherwise a few rare
  characters you may add to the database cannot be written correctly
  to the hard disk (but: TkWiCe will remain fully applicable).

<h3>[04] Installation</h3>
<p>
  There is a install wizard (&quot;setup.tcl&quot;) shipped with
  this softare - use it. Otherwise just copy the program directory
  somewhere you want it, and execute &quot;tkwice.tcl&quot; (in
  fact there is no installation necessary). If you need advice in
  a installation by hand, there is a manual in the main directory
  of the software archive.
</p>

<a name="5"></a>
<h3>[05] Possibilities &amp; Limitations</h3>
<p>
  TkWiCe is not designed to be the fastest database - instead every
  wine gets an own plain text file with everything in it (the photos
  are of course separated - they aren't plain text). The advantages:
  You can build up own scripts to complete TkWiCe with functions you
  are missing, and as the content can be read out even without TkWiCe,
  everything is as &quot;future-sure&quot; as possible.
</p><p>
  As a result of own plain text files the maximum amount of datasets
  is a) limited to the filesystem you are using, and b) to 999.999
  different wines. That's every day another wine in the next 2.740
  years - I think this should be enough (if it's not and you need a
  real database behind, it shouldn't be a problem for you to pay me
  for such an interface). Also the maximum amount of bottles of each
  wine is 999. To solve this &quot;problem&quot; you also could pay
  me - six really great bottles shouldn't be a problem for someone
  with such a wine cellar ;)

  Started to write TkWiCe from scratch as a platform-independent program
  (and without a clue about programming) in June 2006, because there was
  no acceptable wine cellar software running on FreeBSD.

<h3>[07] Promotion</h3>
<p>
  The author rarely goes on holiday, owns none huge or expensive wine
  cellar, drives only a small car and is low paid. IF YOU REALLY LIKE
  THIS LITTLE PROGRAM, and as the author never wastes thoughts about
  getting rich (should I?), and spents far to much time on this project,
  it would be a nice thing to get some prop to go on:
</p><ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Money<br>
  To say it clear: The software is free, no money has to be payed.
  But as you can read above it would be a nice thing (how much is
  secondary - I won't determine for anyone what this software has to
  be worth for its usage):<br><br>
  Depositor: Joachim Moskalewski<br>
  Bank: Kreissparkasse Boeblingen (Germany)<br>
  Bank code: 603 501 30<br>
  Account number: 365 46 80<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Wine<br>
  Needed to write such software and can be send to the author ;)
  Authentical red wine from a real winegrower is prefered - not
  from a huge company. Also organic wines are prefered.</li>
  <li>Help<br>
  People with translation skills, knowledge about growing areas,
  grapes, having fun on writing documentations and so on are welcome ;)</li>

  Some parts of TkWiCe are own projects. Here they are (alphabetically):
