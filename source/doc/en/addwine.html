<h1>Easy Adding Wines</h1>

<p>
  So your in front of a wine bottle and want to add it to your database.
  You either can press the &raquo;New&laquo; icon in the top bar of the
  main window, or the &raquo;Next Vintage&laquo; icon. Last one may be
  a good idea even if your wine isn't a &raquo;Next Vintage&laquo; of a
  already added wine: Sometimes it is easier to change a form than to
  fill it completely. At least if the winerey is already known to your
  database, select the according entry, choose &raquo;Next Vintage&laquo;,
  and change the values.
</p><p>
  So you're now in front of the wine editor. Fill out anything you know,
  but on some fields there is something to know:
</p>

<h2>Growing Areas</h2>
<p>
  For example your wine is a &raquo;Cotes du Ventoux&laquo;, and all
  you know beside of this is that this should be a french growing area.
  So you open the regions help window, select France, switch to the
  &raquo;search&laquo; mode and type in &quot;vent&quot; - you will
  notice that the selectable list will get shorter with any chracter
  you're typing in. After this four chars you're able to double click
  on the desired line and it will be taken over to your wine editor.
</p><p>
  Another, even nicer thing is the &raquo;choose&laquo; button, but
  you may need more knowledge: In the above example you've got to know,
  that the Cotes du Ventoux is a part of the Rhone, though geological
  it is a part of the Provence ... (the winemakers just thought the
  reputation of the Rhone is the better choice, so they decided to
  join the Rhone constraints). Easy select &quot;France&quot; - after
  this is done, the middle listbox will be filled with the according
  regions. Choose Rhone, and in the third you will find the Ventoux.
  Double click on it.
</p>

<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>
  Only if there are known classifications of the country you can use the
  help button to get a list of them. Some combinations of regions and
  classes will set the barrel automatically to its minimum settings
  (f.e. a Crianza from Spain was at least 6 months in a barrel).
  Other program parts also can do auto completions, so it could be a good
  idea in general to set up the real known parts first, and wait for stuff
  to look after at the latter.
</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
  The list shown by the input help tool contains the by the author so
  far seen sorts and association related to this topic. There may be
  much more outside ...
</p>

<h2>Grape</h2>
<p>
  The help button presents you a list of known grapes used to make
  wine. As this list is real hugh, you can type in characters into the
  &raquo;Search&laquo; box - and by each character the list will get
  shorter. For example to find &raquo;Cabernet Sauvignon&laquo; you may
  type in &raquo;s&laquo;, &raquo;a&laquo;, &raquo;u&laquo; ... and you
  will see the wanted in the much shorter list.
</p><p>
  A problem is to know the propper orthography of a grape name:
  &raquo;K&eacute;kfrankos&laquo; you won't find by entering a
  &raquo;e&laquo; instead of a &raquo;&eacute;&laquo; (one thing on
  the TODO list), so play around with different charakter parts of
  the grape name if the result isn't what you expected.
</p><p>
  You can take over additional notes, for example the better known name
  of a grape or the hybrid parents; This information will appear in
  brackets. Anything in brackets here isn't shown in the list of the
  main window.
</p>

<h2>Dealer</h2>
<p>
  The help button shows you a list of dealers which were already added
  to your dealer database; To add, delete or edit this database, open
  the dealer database from the main manu on the main window. Beside of
  this, a so far unknown manually entered dealer will be added to the
  dealer database automatically.
</p>

<h2>Quantity</h2>
<h3>Amount</h3>
<p>
  Can be edited; But this will be done automatically by using the
  &raquo;In&laquo; or &raquo;Out&laquo; button. Do not touch this
  until it is necessarry.
</p>

<h3>Button &raquo;Out&laquo;</h3>
<p>
  Deactivated while the actual stock is zero ;) The rest is equal the
  previous button.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  Can be edited, too; But this will be done automatically by using the
  &raquo;Outgoing Bottles&laquo; button, so there is the same hint
  as in the last two topics.
</p>

<h2>Ratings</h2>
<p>
  Most are done in five steps; You can mark or unmark (second mouse click)
  a step and change its value, you can move a mark button like a slider,
  and you can update your choice by simply select another value. Moving
  with the mouse over them shows their meaning, which you also get with
  a right mose click on them as a menu. This menu is also opened by using
  the help buttons.
</p><p>
  Some ratings effect the automatic points calculation, some not. Their
  color represent their grade.
</p>

<h2>Corkquality</h2>
<p>
  Deactivated while the stopper isn't a kind of cork ;)
</p>

<h2>Aroma</h2>
<p>
  Presents you a kind of digital conversion of well known wine
  aroma wheels. By selecting anything on the left, the lists on the
  right from it only contains the corresponding aromas; So go from the
  left to the right in it.<br>
  You can set up the first two aromas of your wine; If you need more,
  use other software - or even better: A text processor.
</p>

<h2>Save</h2>
<p>
  The wine editor checks really many things before saving, so you
  shouldn't be able to save a corrupt dataset. For example adding
  a summary of more than 100% grapes will end up in blinking
  percentages ...<br>
  Other records will be completed - so if you said the wine is to drink
  up this year, the &raquo;Next Bottle&laquo; entry will be (if unset so
  far) set automatically to the actual date etc.
