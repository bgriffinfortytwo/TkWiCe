<h1>Image Handling</h1>

<p>
  Images are saved separate from the wine editor; That means: If you
  see one displayed in the wine editor window, it is already saved -
  regardless if you're aborting or saving the wine editor. There are
  different ways to add a photo:
</p>

<h2>Main Window</h2>
<p>
  Opening the photo window will show you the photo added to a selected
  wine - so if you're clicking through your winelist, this window will
  be updated by every selection; It is a browser.
</p><p>
  You can change or add the photos from here - but: Don't forget to
  save the image after changing - otherwise your changes will be lost.
  After saving the &raquo;Save&laquo; button will be deactivated,
  until a new image will be chosen.
</p>

<h2>Wine Editor</h2>
<p>
  You will get exactly the same window, but it will not browse through
  a list (instead it will be closed when you close the wine editor).
  Note that just as adding from the main window you've got to save
  a photo separate in its own window - just saving with the button
  from the wine editor does not save any photo.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
  Note that corresponding to your installation it may be you're only
  able to select (the realy slow) GIF images; For more formats
  you need the Img extension to Tcl/Tk (most users may have it).
</p><p>
  The images were stored in 300x500 pixel size, so it is recommended to
  serve only those sizes to the database; Otherwise they may be croped
  or bordered. Note that the job of this program part is not to be a
  image manipulating software - therefore other software (like
  &raquo;The Gimp&laquo; - http://www.gimp.org/) ever will be better,
  so this software won't try to beat them.<br>
  But: If your in front of a unixoid system, and you've got the Img
  extension as well as ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
  installed, you don't have to think about sizes; These tools will
  automatically be used, and everything will be done for you.
