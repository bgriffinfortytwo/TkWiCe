<h1>The Main Window</h1>
<p>
  This document describes the main window, its behaviour, and its
  elements.
</p>

<h2>Menubar</h2>
<p>
  The first button is the mainmenu; As in many other menus
  too, you can tear it off it by selecting the dashed line.
</p>
<h3>New</h3>
<p>
  If you want to add a completely new wine to the databes use this.
  Please read the explanation of the &raquo;Next Vintage&laquo;-button,
  too.
</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>
  This button can only be pressed if you selected one wine from
  the list. You will get a new window in which you can change anything
  correspondig to the selected wine.
</p>

<h3>Next Vintage</h3>
<p>
  This button can only be pressed if you selected one wine
  from the list. You will get a new entry into your database correspondig
  to the selectetd wine, but one year younger. Note that some of your
  entries won't be added, because they might have changed with the new
  vintage.<br>
  If you want to add any other wine from a already in the databes
  known winery using this button might be a really good idea - you've only
  got to change some things, but don't have to enter everything about the
  winery. Due to your filter settings it might be that you won't see a
  result of pressing this button (for example the amount of bottles is
  zero until you entered the amount - so if you're in front of the
  &raquo;Available&laquo; list ... but in that case you will see an
  notice, too).
</p>

<h3>Delete</h3>
<p>
  This button can only be pressed if you selected one wine from
  the list. You will be asked if you're sure.
</p>

<h3>Label</h3>
<p>
  Opens the photo window in browser mode in a own window.
</p>

<h3>Search</h3>
<p>
  There you can type in any string, and by pressing the button
  or enter the wine list will be updated. Note that the result will also
  consider any other selectetd filter. Note also that this filter will
  be last until you press enter or the button with a clear entry.
</p>


<h2>Countrybar</h2>
<p>
  Here you can select or deselect countries from your wine list:
</p><ul>
  <li>first click selects a country</li>
  <li>second removes a country from the selection</li>
</ul><p>
  To select all countries you can deselect all done selections, select
  all countries, or simply use the &raquo;All&laquo;-button on the left.
  If there are too many buttons to fit to window width you can scroll
  them with the scroll bar on the bottom right.
</p>


<h2>Winelist</h2>
<p>
  A single mous click selects a database entry, and a double mouse click
  opens it in the wine editor.
</p><p>
  You can sort the list with a mouse click on the labels on the top
  line of the list; A second click will invert their order.
</p><p>
  As of too many fields their sizes can't be changed within the list -
  therefore use the preferences.
</p><p>
  On Microsoft Windows the mouse wheel scroll seems not to work - not
  my fault. Trust me, with open source software such things work ;)
</p><p>
  It was planed to make it optical penetrably which wine is white -
  instead of reading the word &raquo;White&laquo; in the list (would also
  be smaller, which means more space for other relevant informations).
  But: With a nice, small sign it isn't possible to differ between Red
  and Ros&eacute;, and a bigger one figured out to be ugly. The next side
  effect was: Much slower (on the authors very old computer). So you can
  get it if you want (it's in the preferences), but by default you see t
  he word instead of a color box.
</p>


<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>
  If you click on a selected button it will be deactivated - so the
  (superfluous) &raquo;All&laquo; button will be activated.
</p>

<h2>Show</h2>

<h3>Available</h3>
<p>
  All database entries with an amount greater than zero are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Try</h3>
<p>
  All database entries with an amount greater than zero and none taste
  note or drink history are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Drink</h3>
<p>
  All database entries with an amount greater than zero and a valid
  date of &raquo;Next Bottle&laquo; are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Modified</h3>
<p>
  Any database entry which is written/changed in the last five days
  is displayed. So it's easy to find a opened wine with amount zero to
  add a tasting note etc.
</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
  If you activate &raquo;Bio&laquo;, only wines with a not false or
  unset bio entry are listed. Of course this button only makes sense
  if you've filled out the corresponding entries carefully.
</p>


<h2>Statusbar</h2>
<p>
  On startup it will tell you where your database and where this
  software is stored on your drive.<br>
  If you select a wine, you will see the wine name and vintage
  completely.
</p><p>
  Additional you get a short summary of your wine cellar.
</p>


<h2>Window Placement</h2>
<p>
  A usable window manager draws a new window on a proper place on your
  desktop. As this software runs with various systems (and as the author
  notices that the most popular computer system has great trouble with
  such really basic stuff ...), you can predefine the behaviour of the
  window placement in the preferences.
</p>

<h2>Window Size</h2>
<p>
  There are also other settings which are relevant for the window itself;
  The size corresponds to your settings of:
</p><ul>
  <li>font size</li>
  <li>font family</li>
  <li>amount of characters in the wine list</li>
  <li>amount of lines in the wine list</li>
</ul>
