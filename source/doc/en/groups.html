<h1>Groups</h1>

<p>
  TkWiCe has many builting groups available: You're able to select country
  groups, color groups, drinkable wines, wines which are still to try, and
  so on. But:
</p><p>
  In some reasons it might be helpfull for you to define your own groups:
  For example you want to set up groups with &raquo;Chianti&laquo;,
  &raquo;Vino Nobile&laquo;, &raquo;Brunello&laquo; and
  &raquo;Supertuscan&laquo;&nbsp;- so you have separated the tuscan
  types of wine from their overlapping growing areas. Or you want to
  put the wines for your next tasting event together. Or the ones of
  rack &raquo;A&laquo; etc.
</p>

<h2>New Group</h2>
<p>
  Before adding a wine to a group, you must of course create such a
  group first. The tool for this is the group manager, which can be
  found in the main menu of the main window. Note that deleting a
  existing group doesn't delete the wine&nbsp;- the group database
  is of course completely separated from the wine database. And any
  change will be processed immediately without need of confirmation,
  click on &raquo;Save&laquo; or anything else like this.
</p>

<h2>Adding Wines</h2>
<p>
  There is a group button in the top button bar of the main window.
  You'll get a window with a list of all created groups. Clicking on
  a group adds the selected wine to it, a second click deselects it
  from the list. Changes will only take effect after saving them.
</p>

<h2>Show a Group</h2>
<p>
  Use the filter button bar on the right of the main window. Selecting
  a group will update the wine list. Note that any other filter you
  selected will still work, too.
</p>
