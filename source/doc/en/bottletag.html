<h1>Bottle Tags</h1>

<p>
  TkWiCe can create printable bottle tag files, which can be put over
  a bottle in Your wine cellar; So You will be able to identify the
  bottles and their important informations without taking them out of
  the wine rack. You find this feature inside the main menu of the main
  window: A HTML file will be written, which can be opened and printed
  from a web browser.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
  To be platform independent this feature is realized in HTML: There are
  many different printing systems with many different facilities around.
  So a platform independent output format is chosen which anyone should
  be able to print. On the other side this HTML output may cause some
  other problems: To get right dimensions of the bottle tags you need web
  browser with basic CSS2 support (f.e. Mozilla or Firefox work). Although
  CSS2 is already standardized in the last millennium, some browsers may
  still have trouble with this (f.e. Internet Explorer 7 ...).
</p><p>
  The sense of these bottle tags is not to waste paper; You may own
  some bottles which should not be shaked every time you search for
  a bottle in your cellar. So you see clearly without taking the
  bottle out of the storage when it should be drunk, and what's behind
  this bottle neck.<br>
  Another thing is by that way you can handle storage IDs: You may have
  a system as &quot;Left wall, row 7&quot; - so you may name it
  &quot;L7&quot; to find it. The ID is limited to six characters.
</p><p>
  Six bottle tags will be printed at once. The whole dimension should be
  about 15x23 cm (each alone 7,6x7,6 cm, so it is not bigger than a wine
  bottles diameter). Cut them out. On the middle you see a cross - cut
  along the not dashed line and fold the dashed line; So you can pull
  them over your bottle necks.
</p><p>
  To make them look somewhat nicer you've got to use better paper ;)
