<h1>History</h1>

<p>
  There are two histories, which are saved separate: The history of
  exactly one wine is stored within the wine database, and can be
  changed by editing the wine itself in the wine editor.<br>
  The second is a global history including all wines, and is also
  saved separate; It is not updated if you change the history in
  the wine editor - it's like a written book.
</p><p>
  Both histories are splitted in buying and drinking.
</p>

<h2>Wine History</h2>
<p>
  Can be found inside of the wine editor. Use the &raquo;In&laquo; and
  &raquo;Out&laquo; button to update it. An already done entry can be
  edited by simply clicking on it ...
</p><p>
  The wine history is stored inside of the wines database file, means
  after explicit saving your modifications. But: A second entry goes
  directly to the global history and is saved immediately.
</p>


<h2>Global History</h2>
<p>
  NOTE: Changes from the &raquo;In&laquo; and &raquo;Out&laquo; button
  affect the global history without saving; So if you exit the wine
  editor without saving, your changes to the global history are already
  saved anyway.
</p><p>
  To view it have a look at the main windows menubar - it opens a separate
  window, which shows you any bought or drunken wine and some interesting
  summaries. Any entry you made to the wine history will also be added
  to the global history - but as the global history is stored separate,
  later changes of the wine history entries won't affect the global
  history - in fact it's like a written book. A timeline of the wine
  you bought and drunk.
</p><p>
  Note that therefore you should first fill out the complete dataset
  of a wine, and enter your purchase or empty bottle later. Otherwise
  a missing price (for example) won't affect this history anymore until
  you change it in there manually.
