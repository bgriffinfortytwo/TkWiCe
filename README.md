# TkWiCe
TkWiCe is an easy to use, free and open source application for wine
cellars.

The program structure is basically an administrative tool, and
provides a fast overview of your wine bottles.

Aims
* Focus is on pleasure, not on science.
* Function conquers eyecandy.
* Own plain text files for each wine.
* Fits on displays with 1024x768 pixel.
* Old computers are new enough.
* No more dependencies than Tcl/Tk (not: operating system).
* Free (means: liberty, free of charge and open source).
